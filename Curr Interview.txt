Android that can be a smartphone or tablets and even in Windows. So, if I am creating an Android web view application from this URL, the user of the web view application will face no

Procedure - 
Back End - So, in this particular application, I fetched all the related data that connects the different currencies with the help of API by using fetch function in the backend, i.e,
JavaScript(js) file.

Front End - While in the front end, to choose the conversion from 1 particular currency to another currency, we created a drop down menus with the help of options tag after that the conversion 
procedure is been controlled by the 'convert' function in the backend while we create a button in the front end that can call the convert function when being clicked once, i.e., after the
on-click event is triggered.
